WHAT I HAVE DONE:
-sorted the files into the same dir system as the original data
-renamed the files so they follow the same naming convention as the orginal data
-downsided all of them using pillow with the 'NEAREST' downsampleing method
added the extra classes in that were in the orignal dataset but not in this one, this allows you to simply run the og model
on this data and it will be able to classify them without changing our model code
-removed any undded data and extras that were included in the raw data for this dataset
