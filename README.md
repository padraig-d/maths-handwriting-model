## Getting Started
Virtual environment is not necessary since we will be using the latest versions.
Standard dependencies in `requirements.txt`
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

PyTorch is not multiplatform, so you'll need to select the correct version for your hardware [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Follow the instructions and run the command given. If you have no GPU, pick the CPU option.
## Data
Dataset consists of 27,000 images of the symbols `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,*,-,+,/,w,x,y,z` (1,500 each).
It has yet to be sorted correctly.
